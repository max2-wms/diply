# Diply Coding Test

## Step 1: Install Node, NPM

Install Node and NPM on your machine; this typically requires administrative access, 
e.g. become root or use `sudo` (or use a Windows installer).

You must be running at least Node 4.x.x and npm 3.x.x. You can verify 
what, if any, versions you have installed by running `node -v` and 
`npm -v` in a terminal window.

You can download current versions of these tools [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/).

If you use a Linux-like environment, you are encouraged to use your
package manager to install these tools.

If you use OS X, you may wish to consider installing via [HomeBrew](http://brew.sh/).

## Step 2: Install the NPM dependencies

`$ npm install`

## Step 3: Development server

Run `$ npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Step 4: Build

Run `$ npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
